This app shows the predicted shoreline of the Salton Sea from 2018 to 2047 in five-year increments as well as the emissivity of the exposed playa. The end year is 2047, because after that, the Sea is predicted to stabilize.

Landowners of areas around the Salton Sea are also shown to see who may be potentially responsible for mitigating future dust emissions.
